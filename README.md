# Grading-Program
A program that uses an answer key and student answers to grade exams

The program reads the answer key file and stores the answers into an array
It then checks the answers of each student and compares it to the answer key
The results are then printed on the screen and notifies the user if the each student passed or failed
The program also prints out which student did the best and which one did the worst
Lastly all of the results are printed out into an output text file
